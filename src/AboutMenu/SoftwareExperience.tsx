Long story short, that business didn't work out. After a short stint at a startup, I decided to take time to reassess my priorities and consider what I wanted long-term. I've always enjoyed writing software, but only if it was to serve a purpose I found valuable.",

My professional experience is backend focused but I really enjoy doing all aspects. I am not a “technology” person in that I don't enjoy technology for its own sake, but rather as a medium for sharing my ideas with the world.",
